 Faculty Course Assessment Report(FCAR)
Motivation:
In VRSEC, each course will be assessed by 5 types (A1, S1, A2, S2, F). It is a tedious task to the faculty to assess the course they have dealt. 


Problem Description:
•	A student's performance will be assessed by the marks attained. Similarly every
Course performance has to be assessed. For any course (educational) there
Will be a process and we need to check whether the student is been able to
Reach above the given thresholds (fixed).
Social Benefits:
•	Helps the teaching faculty to check the attainment levels for the courses they have delivered.
•	It is an effective and efficient tool used to bring together all relevant course related information and blend into a single document.
•	It reflects on the part of instructor as to what was effective, and suggestions for further improvements. 

Innovation and Uniqueness:
•	Developing complete end to end web application by using modern python framework Djangowhich gives an effective outcome.
•	The assessment process measures the performance criteria using the appropriate instruments that were selected by the coordinators.


Feasible Solution:
•	Data is collected from the relevant performance criterion using the appropriate instruments, and reported through an online system or through a standard and simple form that documents the process.
•	The FCAR includes a header, grades distribution, program outcome assessment, student feedback, reflection, and proposed actions for course improvement.
